# BatmanGame
Batman game has four characters, Batman, Joker, Harley, and Robin.
As they fight, three different interations are possible.
If two characters at the same level, like Joker and Batman, or Harley and Robin crash, each one loses one life.
If two characters on the same team meet, such as Joker and Harley or Batman and Robin, they give each other one life each.
If a stronger character hits a weaker character, like Joker hitting Robin or Batman hitting Harley, only the "sidekick" character loses a life.
The game ends when either Batman or Joker die. If both die at the same time, it's a tie.
But, if Batman dies first, Joker wins and a "loss" screen appears. 
However, if Joker dies before Batman, you win!
